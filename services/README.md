# Instructions
Once downloaded the repo and opened it in an editor, the only thing needed to run a service is to move into the folder of the chosen service (e.g. babysitter-server, consultant-server or party-server) and simply start it using the ` npm start ` command.

### Babysitter service

` cd .\services\babysitter\babysitter-server\ `

 ` npm start `

 ### Pedagogical Consultant service

` cd .\services\consultant\consultant-server\ `

 ` npm start `

 ### Party service
 
` cd .\services\party\party-server\`

 ` npm start `

 _Note that **Babysitter service** handles all the babysitter-related services for both the parents and the babysitters themselves_
