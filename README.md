# Babies360

We want to model the service offered by an agency specialized in providing services to new parents. The company relies on the services offered by professionals such as babysitters, pedagogical consultants and event organizers.
Based on the requests of the parents the agency help them by coordinating the communication with other service providers.

## Members:
* member A (Francesca, Grimaldi, 10744925) 
* member B (Matteo, Fiorentino, 10686260)
* member C (Gabriele, Lazzarelli, 10623766)

## Choreographed process
In our design, the parents query babies360 for the available service, then if interesed they can choose a service.
Each service request has different parameters based on the type of service requested, e.g. the `date` and `time` and for how many `hours` in case of the babysitter request.

Each service provision differs from one another:
- the babysitting provision takes place in the babies360 platform from start to finish, the parents decide which babysitter they know from the available ones, the payment has to take place before the service in order to deliver it.
- in the party planner provision the parents decides only which type of services (among "party services", e.g., catering) they will need, then a party planner will search the best solution for each category and will report back to babies360, then babies360 will send a proposal to the parents. If the proposal is accepted the plan is confirmed, the payment will be deducted after the party.
- for the consultant service babies360 acts only as a professional search portal, in this case the value is gained from the consultants which pay a fee for each appointment they make thanks to the babies360 platform.
